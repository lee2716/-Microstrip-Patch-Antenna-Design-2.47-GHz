# -Microstrip-Patch-Antenna-Design-2.47-GHz

This repository contains the CST simulation and analysis of a microstrip patch antenna designed for a resonant frequency of 2.47 GHz. The project covers the entire design workflow, including:

Antenna Structure: Microstrip patch with FR-4 substrate and copper ground plane
Simulation Parameters: Time-domain solver, S-parameter analysis, impedance tuning
Performance Optimization: Feeding slot adjustments, resonance fine-tuning, bandwidth evaluation
Final Results: Achieved -30 dB reflection coefficient with a bandwidth of ~60 MHz
